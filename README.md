# Hearth-Failure-Prediction

Hello and welcome! In this notebook, I will guide you through the process of analyzing and predicting heart disease using a dataset containing key features related to heart health. The goal of this notebook is to </br>build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various input features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.</br>

Throughout this notebook, we will:</br>

  Explore and preprocess the dataset
  Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights</br>
  Train machine learning models for heart disease prediction</br>
  Evaluate and fine-tune the model to improve accuracy</br>
